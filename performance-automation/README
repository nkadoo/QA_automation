To run the file in non-GUI mode, use following command which will create a new Results folder with graph reports.

./jmeter.sh -n -t /path/to/your/jmx_file -l /path/to/jtl_file -e -o /path/to/Results_folder

Update above command with the path where you have your jmx file. Give path where you want your jtl file to be created and path to folder
where you want to create reports folder.

Once your test is run, you will see a reports file created under the results folder.
